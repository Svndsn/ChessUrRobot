# ChessUrRobot
This code is used for a UR5 robot to interface with a chess engine making it able to play against a human in real life.

## INTERFACES
The code uses a standard UCI engine and UCI commands to interface with the engine. The robot is handled with a MODBUS interface standard from Universal Robot. The robot is using a gripper manufactured and designed by us and using a ATMEGA64 we are able to open and close it.
